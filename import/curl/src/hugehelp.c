"       supported protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, TFTP, DICT,  TELNET,  LDAP\n"

"\n"
"       curl offers a busload of useful tricks like proxy support, user authen-\n"
"       tication, ftp upload, HTTP post,  SSL  (https:)  connections,  cookies,\n"
"       file  transfer  resume  and  more. As you will see below, the amount of\n"
"       features will make your head spin!\n"
"\n"

"       curl is powered by  libcurl  for  all  transfer-related  features.  See\n"

"URL\n"
"       The  URL  syntax is protocol dependent. You'll find a detailed descrip-\n"

"\n"
"       You can specify multiple URLs or parts of URLs  by  writing  part  sets\n"
"       within braces as in:\n"
"\n"
"        http://site.{one,two,three}.com\n"
"\n"
"       or you can get sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:\n"

"        ftp://ftp.letters.com/file[a-z].txt\n"
"\n"
"       No nesting of the sequences is supported at the moment, but you can use\n"
"       several ones next to each other:\n"
"\n"
"        http://any.org/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html\n"
