# Progress Log

## 2026-07-03 — init
Initialized norman for the security-review follow-ups (docs/security-review-2026-07-03.md).
9 tasks in Phase 1. Prior context: Blocker+High findings already fixed and pushed
to main (SMTP relay policy, XFF, conn cap, HMAC body, cookies/HSTS, CSRF, PROXY
protocol, single-node server-mode fixes).

PATTERN: [smtp] Session relay policy lives in internal/smtp/server.go; real client
IP available via PROXY protocol (internal/netx). Backend has a per-IP conn counter
map (perIP) already — reuse/extend for rate limiting.
PATTERN: [headers] sanitizeHeaderValue(v) strips CRLF in internal/smtp/server.go —
reuse the same approach for compose/bounce header building.
PATTERN: [config] All config blocks are REQUIRED by strict hclsimple decoding;
adding fields is fine but every block must be present in config files.
